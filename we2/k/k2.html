		<h1><i>Halebid, Karnataka</i></h1>
		<p> South Indian towns are known for their exquisite temple architecture. 
		Halebid in Karnataka is no exception. Here, you will find the ruins of the Hoysala Dynasty, 
		which ruled the region for 150 years. Halebid is also called Dwarasamudra or the gateway to the seas. 
		It is indeed one of the most beautiful places to visit in India.</p>
<p>The ruins resulted from frequent invasions by Malik Kafur and his armies, 
who ransacked the region in the 14th century. Come to Halebid and experience a walk through 
Indiaâ€™s colourful history. You can also visit Belur and Shravanabelagola, 
where you will find beautiful Jain monuments. These marvellous ancient structures 
make Halebid the best tourist place in India.</P>
