		<p> Do you wish to walk over the longest hanging bridge to cross a raging river below? 
		Then you have to visit Damro in Arunachal Pradesh, another lesser-known tourist place in India. 
		Your visit to this state will be unlike any other trip, as you will get to see and experience the 
		authentic tribal lifestyle. Here, you will find bamboo houses with thatched roofs, swaying bridges
		made with wood, and tamed bison.</p>
<p>You have got to come here once, and you will resent going back to your city life. 
The Damro Labokellie Tea Garden is an excellent addition to this already beautiful place. 
You can even form a relationship with the hospitable locals and work alongside them in the fields, 
which is something you wonâ€™t find in other places to visit in India. The best time to visit Damro 
would be between October and April.</P>
